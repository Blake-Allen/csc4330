# Introduction
##1.1 Purpose
  The purpose of this Software Design Document is 
  
##1.2 Intended Audience
  The need for a text editor like DuoMonkeyEditor will solve major problems that pair programmers face. DuoMonkeyEditor was created to target the vast market of any software developers who practices pair programming. This application could be used in the industry, however, our initial implementation will specifically target students to eleminate the problems that arrise when writing code with another student.
