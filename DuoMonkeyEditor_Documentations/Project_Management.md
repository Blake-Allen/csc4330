Vision
======
The ultimate goal of our project is to develop a web-based text editor that solves a big issue of pair programming, which is location. A lot of us can all understand the problems of finding time to be able to get together with our partners (if not, sucks to be you). Our final product will deliver a simple text editor that has synchronized editing and a messaging system that allows communication between the two programmers.

Configuration Management Plan
=============================
The project source code and important documentations will be stored in GitHub and ***only*** approved changes will be allowed to merge with the repository. GitHub will provide the necessary means to resolve conflicts should two or more changes (or upload) interfere with each other. We expect everyone to do their delegated tasks and upload their files via a pull request in a timely manner, so the group can look over the file.
