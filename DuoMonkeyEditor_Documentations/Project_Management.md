Vision
========
The ultimate goal of our project is to develop a web-based text editor that solves a big issue of pair programming, which is location. A lot of us can all understand the problems of finding time to be able to get together with our partners (if not, sucks to be you). Our final product will deliver a simple text editor that has synchronized editing and a messaging system that allows communication between the two programmers.
